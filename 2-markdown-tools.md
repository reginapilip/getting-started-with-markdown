### Markdown All in One Highlights

I like this extension because it provides a better user experience

  - Combines many features into one single extension

This extension also **converts your Markdown into HTML** by a simple command.

- Press Enter - a new HTML file will show up in your file structure!

It can also **generate (and automatically update) a table of contents**

- Press Enter - now you have a table of contents!
