# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a **lightweight markup language** created by John Gruber in 2004. 

## Markdown is Easy to Use
Markdown allows you to stay focused on your task by taking away the need to click buttons for formatting. Its syntax allows you to keep your hands on your keyboard at all times. 

## Markdown is Easy to Read
Unlike HTML, Markdown's minimalistic syntax isn't intrusive. 

Take a look:

```html
<h1>What is Markdown?</h1>
<p>Markdown is a <strong>a lightweight markup language</strong> created by John Gruber in 2004.</p>
```

```markdown
Markdown is a **lightweight markup language** created by John Gruber in 2004.
```

## Markdown is Convenient

- It is portable, platform independent, future proof and supported across many different websites, tools, and apps.
